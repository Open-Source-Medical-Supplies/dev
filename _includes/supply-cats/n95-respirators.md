# OSCMS - N95 Respirators

---

# The Problem:

N95 respirators protect healthcare workers from exposure to airborne droplets and aerosolized viruses by filtering inspired air. They have different sizes and must be fitted to the healthcare worker once per year. N95 respirators are typically made from specialized material called meltblown fabric which is difficult to source outside the N95 manufacturing chain.

# Current Global Resources:

There have been reports of N95 shortages at hospitals due to theft and overuse by the public. Importantly, hospitals maintain inventory based on their general needs. With the spread of COVID-19, the need now exceeds hospital inventories and the capability of manufacturers. Companies that have stockpiles for worker usage - construction, painting, labs and others - are donating their masks, but this will not fill the need. As a result, the CDC has provided guidelines for respirator reuse (see below). The FDA has provided Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for sterilization of N95 respirators (see below). **[4/1/20]**

# Worst Case Expectation:

"HHS estimates the U.S. could need up to 3.5 billion N95 respirator masks" over the course of a year in a pandemic (HHS estimate, [Time](https://time.com/5800200/strategic-national-stockpile-coronavirus/)) [**3/10/20**]

# Engineering Requirements:

- Proper fit to face; if a respirator does not fit properly, contaminated air can leak past the seal into the respirator. This is vital.
- Light weight
- High particulate removal down to required PM size
- Low cost and/or ability to sanitize
- Typical US hospital practice would be to discard N95 after each patient contact. CDC guidelines during N95 respirator shortage state that reuse of the same mask is appropriate. Proper storage and care is necessary to prolong the reuse of the respirator. Chance of transmission is low from the mask to the patient, but care is required (proper technique when removing the respirator) in order to avoid contact transmission by HCP from handling the mask.

# Assembly/Fabrication Requirements:

- “MERV 13 or higher FILTRETE filters can be used to make DIY N95 masks”
