# OSCMS - Laryngoscopes

# The Problem:

- Instrument used to expose and view the larynx and surrounding areas during orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation. Consists of a large cylindrical, hollow, slightly ribbed handle with a threaded head compatible with different blade types and sizes. Each blade has fibre optics or a single bulb; bulb is at least a 2.7 V halogen light and is removable for cleaning. Handle is 28 mm diameter and battery powered with two standard alkaline dry-cell batteries (1.5 V, type C (LR14)).
    - Blades, Macintosh type (curved):
        - No. 2, length 90–110 mm, for child
        - No. 3, length 110–135 mm, for small adult
        - No. 4, length 135–155 mm, for adult
    - Blades, Miller type (straight):
        - No. 1, length 100 mm Heavy-walled plastic or metal case
- “There are many different kinds of laryngoscopes- they are used to feed a fiber optic camera into the larynx. The blade attachment is what will likely be needed if a lot of patients require this"
