# OSCMS - Goggles

---

# The Problem:

Goggles are often used for secondary droplet protection during COVID19 treatment. While washable, not all healthcare facilities have them in stock.

# Current Global Resources:

# Worst Case Expectation:

- World Health Organization: “1.6 million goggles” (each month, globally) ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/04/hhs-clarifies-us-has-about-1percent-of-face-masks-needed-for-full-blown-pandemic.html), 3/4/20) ([WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/03-03-2020-shortage-of-personal-protective-equipment-endangering-health-workers-worldwide) 3/3/20)

# Engineering Requirements:

# Assembly/Fabrication Requirements:

Mask: the simplicity of the shape allows to obtain the object very quickly even from 20mm polystyrene sheets (better XPF) without needing to print it in 3D: template file "visiera_Template.pdf" for laser cutter, foam cutter, cnc cutters has been loaded. (Luca, 3/15/20)

### DISCLAIMER:

an ineffective protection can be more dangerous than having nothing because it tends to reduce the level of prudence: make a responsible use of it. Use suitable materials and glues to reduce the risk of breakage and therefore exposure during use.
