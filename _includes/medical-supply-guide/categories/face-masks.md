# OSCMS - Face Masks

---

# The Problem:
N95 respirators and other forms of filtering face masks are in short supply, and people who don’t need them are buying them. Surgical masks can serve lighter duty uses, but are also in short supply. As supplies continue to dwindle, alternatives to conventional use of PPE are necessary.

In healthcare settings, fabric face masks are best used to protect existing N95s and surgical masks. Fabric face masks worn alone to provide some filtration are also an emergency option when PPE is not available. However, it is known that these masks do not provide the same level of protection as surgical masks or N95 respirators. It is not yet known whether re-use protocols for N95 respirators is preferable to using cloth masks alone.

For members of the general public, surgical face masks are not recommended due to supply shortages. The CDC has issued a [recommendation that members of the general public wear cloth face coverings in public](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html), even when they feel healthy, due to the possibility of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals transmitting the virus without knowing they carry it.

"U.S. Department of Health and Human Services intends to purchase 500 million N95 respirators over the next 18 months for the Strategic National Stockpile " ([HHS, **3/4/20**](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/03/04/hhs-to-procure-n95-respirators-to-support-healthcare-workers-in-covid-19-outbreaks.html))

USA - HHS Strategic National Stockpile: 30,000,000 surgical face masks in Strategic National Stockpile (HHS officials, [Time](https://time.com/5800200/strategic-national-stockpile-coronavirus/)) The Strategic National Stockpile is now “nearly gone” (DHS officials, [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/coronavirus-protective-gear-stockpile-depleted/2020/04/01/44d6592a-741f-11ea-ae50-7148009252e3_story.html), **4/1/20**)

# Engineering Requirements:

## Material Selection:

Construction of face masks includes a trade-off between the filtration efficiency and breathability of the materials selected. Designs that incorporate additional material for filtration should be constructed so that this filter can be removed and replaced. When considering whether to create filters by cutting HEPA filters (such as HVAC filters) it is important to note the contents of the filter, as some filters contain fiberglass that can cause severe lung and skin irritation.

All mask materials must be able to withstand sanitization. Most cloth masks will be sanitized using high heat and/or pressure, either through commercial laundering or autoclaving.

### Filtration Efficiency

### Pressure Drop

# Assembly/Fabrication Requirements:

- Must include documentation with masks with details about materials/fiber content. Documentation should also clarify whether the mask is intended to be worn over existing PPE to prolong the life, or if it is intended to provide filtration (higher number of layers, includes disposable filter and information about how to replace filters).
- Ties are preferred to elastics.
- If elastics are used, they must be non-latex elastic.
- If a mask is intended to go over existing PPE (as in the case of covering an N95 respirator) it should be no more than 2 layers of breathable fabric so that it does not restrict airflow.

# Reviewed Designs:

**CDC Stance on Sewn Masks:** The Center for Disease Control notes that [fabric masks are a crisis response option for clinicians when other supplies are not available](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.html). The CDC has also updated their position regarding the use of cloth masks by the public; the [CDC now recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html) the use of cloth masks (no more than 2 layers) when social distancing is difficult to maintain such as in grocery stores or pharmacies, especially in areas with significant community-based transmission. Social distancing is still VITAL and should be practiced with the utmost care, with or without a mask. The CDC also emphasizes that N95 respirators and surgical masks **must** be reserved for front-line clinicians and should not be used by members of the general public at this time.

*This section is for product designs for **sewn as well as no-sew masks** (links to instructions or downloadable packages) that have been reviewed and approved by medical professionals. When adding a design to this list, please include the (approximate) date of approval, the group or organization that reviewed it, and any modifications they recommend*.*

*****A few notes on fabric masks:** 

- Fabric masks provide different levels of filtration depending on the materials used. Please see our documentation for levels of filtration, and note that all homemade designs are to be used at your own risk. **Based on the available research, clinicians should consider using multiple masks over an 8 hour period if using woven fabric alone (i.e. the mask is not being worn to protect existing PPE from soiling). Store similar to N95s (allowing the mask to hang in a designated area or placed in a paper bag and labeled - with one mask per paper bag). Launder after each use.** Finer weaves are better when using woven material alone.
- **If you are producing for clinicians,** it is best to ensure your local hospitals and local clinicians will accept the mask design you are considering as every hospital/clinician will have their own guidelines. We recommend working through [Make Masks](http://makemasks.org/) as they are taking hospital requests, or with hospitals that have made public requests for sewn masks. [Please see our guide for home sewists for additional groups you can connect with.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQVnocKNgEPNSC4DRp0QV-kKfSrPmVMsczMuq1kcIUxNA8DmvG5PS5S0e8zuPRFNe0VnlGzd6segMsl/pub)
- Almost any breathable design that fits over a respirator and can be worn securely can be used to protect an N95 respirator from soiling, in turn potentially prolonging its availability for use as PPE. **When making masks to protect PPE:**
1. Lighter colors are better because they make it easier to see soiling
2. Use no more than 2 layers for this as no filtration is needed - the goal is protection from soiling only
3. Ensure coverage if using over an N95 (these come in several sizes and from different manufacturers) ****
4. Fit is important, and ties that go around the back of the head are preferred
5. No latex should be used in designs for clinical settings - do not use elastic. ****
6. Using different colors on the front (outside facing; lighter is better) and back (inside facing) part of the mask is ideal so that the sides can easily be recognized.
