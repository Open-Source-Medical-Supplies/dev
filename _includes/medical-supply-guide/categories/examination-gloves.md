# OSCMS - Examination Gloves

---

# The Problem:

COVID-19 lives on surfaces for extended periods of time, between hours and days depending on the surface. Healthcare workers become infected when they touch these surfaces or the patient, and then touch their face. Gloves are a first line of defense for preventing HCW infection.

# Current Global Resources:

# Worst Case Expectation:

- World Health Organization: “76 million examination gloves ” (each month, globally) ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/04/hhs-clarifies-us-has-about-1percent-of-face-masks-needed-for-full-blown-pandemic.html), 3/4/20) ([WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/03-03-2020-shortage-of-personal-protective-equipment-endangering-health-workers-worldwide) 3/3/20)

# Engineering Requirements:

Material

Length

Size

“yes to nitrile gloves, most sources are saying that gloves with the longer sleeves are most preferred since they help avoid contamination of wrists and glove slippage.”

Latex is discouraged due to potential sensitivities/allergies.
