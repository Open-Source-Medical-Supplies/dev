# OSCMS - Face Shields

---

# The Problem:

Patients with COVID-19 experience significant respiratory issues, resulting in coughing. Virus particles are easily spread in the fluids expelled from the patient during episodes of coughing. The face shield is an additional barrier between the healthcare worker and the patient, reduces the risk of viral transmission via airborne droplets, and reduces virus load on face masks worn underneath the face shield.

# Current Global Resources:

Hospitals around the world continue to report shortages of face shields. **[3/28/2020]**

# Worst Case Expectation:

Hospitals and clinicians will exhaust their supply of face shields and have no choice but to treat infectious patients without a face shield to reduce exposure to airborne droplets and contagious body fluids.

# Engineering Requirements:

- Shield made of clear plastic that is firm (i.e. it will not “crinkle” or bend when someone bends forward or backward)
- Should provide complete coverage of the entire face, including the length of the face to the chin, and the sides of the face (ideally 9” x 13” - though many designs will not meet this standard).
- Ideal to have material across top of forehead to prevent ingress of liquids/droplets down the face and provide comfort
- Must be able to be comfortably worn for long shifts (i.e. 12+ hours)
- Adjustable band that is firmly attached around the head and clings closely to the forehead
- Non-latex elastic (if using elastic) or band

# Assembly/Fabrication Requirements:

- Clear polyester film 0.007” thick (other thicknesses and materials such as PET, PETG, polycarbonate, with anti-fog coating ideal)
- 1" wide elastic fabric or other band that can be adjusted; must be comfortable, adjustable, non-latex
- Adhesive-backed closed cell polyurethane foam (depending on the design, this may not always be necessary - please see the design docs)
- Laser cutter or steel rule die
- Stapler and shear
- Heat sealer
- Note: Low-end manufacture possible with scissors, Xacto, stapler

# Reviewed Designs:

*This section is for face shield designs for (links to instructions or downloadable packages) that have been clinically reviewed*. When adding a design to this list, please include the (approximate) date of review, the group or organization that reviewed it, and any modifications they recommend.*

**Designs must be manufactured as described. Review should not be interpreted as official regulatory certification or rigorous peer review. These designs are being used by clinicians and others and they have been critiqued by medical professionals.*
