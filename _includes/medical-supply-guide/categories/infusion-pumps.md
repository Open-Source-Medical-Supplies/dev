# OSCMS - Infusion Pump

# The Problem:

“We often need more than 3 per patient, especially for dobutamine, and they are not complex.”

# Current Global Resources:

# Engineering Requirements:

The infusion pump system should include “Fluid infusion set for the complete fluid pathway from, and including, the drug reservoir or fluid source container (e.g., bag, cassette, vial, syringe), infusion set, extension sets, filters and valves, clamps, up to and including the patient connection; · Components and accessories (e.g., power cord, wireless controller); · Network (i.e., any device or system physically or wirelessly connected to the infusion pump); · Patient; · Environment of use (e.g., clinical setting, temperature, humidity); and · User (e.g., health care provider, lay user, biomedical technicians).”

Requirements include the following:

- Size
- Battery Life
- Rate Mode
- Interval Mode
- Demand Dose
- Syringe Capacity
- Alarms
- Power Source
- Physical Characteristics :
