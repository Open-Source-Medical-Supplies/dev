# OSCMS - Nasal Cannulas

# The Problem:

- Oxygen cannula (nasal prongs) are plastic tubes shaped as two prongs delivering air/oxygen mixture into the nasal cavities and connected to an oxygen administration circuit; cannulae can be designed for low-flow applications (0â€“15 L/min range in general) or high flow (> 15 L/min typically). Oxygen and air/oxygen mixture compatibility, as per ISO 15001; different sizes: adult, paediatric, neonatal
