# OSCMS - Gowns

---

# The Problem:

Healthcare workers are exposed to infectious body fluids when working in close proximity to patients. Coughing, sneezing, and retching can expel droplets, which can transmit disease if the healthcare worker’s clothing comes into contact with these fluids. A protective gown covers the healthcare worker’s clothing so as to reduce the risk of direct contact with contaminated fluids.

# Current Global Resources:

Similar to other PPE, supply chain shortages of gowns have persisted for several weeks. Nurses, doctors, and other healthcare professionals are being asked to disinfect, reuse, and use alternative materials for gowns, including plastic ponchos, poly bags, bed bug sheet materials, and garbage bags.

# Worst Case Expectation:

# Engineering Requirements:

Fabric

Gowns for patients:

Gown fabric needs to be the right mix of cotton/synthetic so it launders well but doesn't create static. Static sparks are an issue for hospitals due to fire hazard from high O2 concentration environments.

Gowns for Healthcare Personnel: **Class 2 Gowns**

- Nonsterile, disposable patient isolation gowns, which are used for routine patient care in healthcare settings, are appropriate for use by patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

The choice of gown should be made based on the level of risk of contamination.

- Certain areas of surgical and isolation gowns are defined as **“critical zones”** where direct contact with blood, body fluids, and/or other potentially infectious materials is most likely to occur. ([ANSI/AAMI PB70](http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/pb70_1206_preview.pdf))
- Medium to high risk of contamination and need for a large critical zone, isolation gowns that claim moderate to high barrier protection ([ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 3 or 4](http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/pb70_1206_preview.pdf)
- For healthcare activities with low, medium, or high risk of contamination, surgical gowns ([ANSI/AAMI PB70 Levels 1-4)](http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/pb70_1206_preview.pdf)These gowns are intended to be worn by healthcare personnel during sterile surgical procedures.
- If the risk of bodily fluid exposure is low or minimal, gowns that claim minimal or low levels of barrier protection ([ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 1 or 2](http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/pb70_1206_preview.pdf) can be used. These gowns should not be worn during surgical or invasive procedures, or for medium to high risk contamination patient care activities.
- A surgical gown can function as a single-use disposable isolation gown, dependent on hospital supply levels. An isolation gown can’t function as a surgical gown because an isolation gown is not sterile.

# Assembly/Fabrication Requirements:

· Single use, disposable or multi-use, washable with appropriate fabric

· Calf length
