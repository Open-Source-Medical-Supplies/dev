# Hospital Beds

# The Problem:

If growth of cases continues unabated, hospital beds will be in short supply. Hospital beds allow for patient care with COVID-19 by...

# Current Global Resources:

- 900,000 US Hospital beds ([OECD](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=HEALTH_REAC#))
    - 2/3rds of these are occupied at any given time ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/185904/hospital-occupancy-rate-in-the-us-since-2001/))
        - Note: these are averages; many hospitals in city centers and suburban areas regularly operate with higher occupancies.
- ICU bed estimates vary, in part because there are many types of ICU beds.
    - According to the [AHA](https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals), there are 97,776 total ICU beds in community hospitals.
- According to CMS cost reports, there are about 62,000 ([Modern Healthcare - Analysis of CMS Cost Reports](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/hospitals/covid-19-could-fill-hospital-beds-how-many-are-there); ). However, some hospitals do not report data to CMS.
    - Large regional referral centers have many more beds than the “average” urban hospital, which has about 10 ICU beds.

# Worst Case Expectation:

“Consider, too, that hospitals in many areas are already near capacity (UW Madison is at something like 90% full and COVID19 is only starting here).” - A.F. 3/15/20
