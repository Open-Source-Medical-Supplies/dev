# Flow-Splitter for Oxygen Supply

# The Problem:

Flow splitter for diversification of oxygen delivery. Each outlet with an independent flowmeter for independently controlled oxygen flow rates. Full scale is graduated in litres per minute (L/min). The device is connected to a single oxygen supply (e.g. concentrator). Input pressure: 50â€“350 kPa.
