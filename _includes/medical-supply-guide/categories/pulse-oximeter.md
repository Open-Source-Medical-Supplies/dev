# Pulse Oximeter

# The Problem:

- Compact portable device to monitor haemoglobin oxygen saturation and calculate the pulse rate of a patient; finger tip or tabletop; battery powered or line powered. SpO2 detection to include the range 70–100% SpO2 resolution: 1% or less Pulse rate detection to include the range 30–240 bpm Pulse rate resolution: 1 bpm or less

# Current Global Resources:

# Worst Case Expectation:
