# OSCMS - Ventilator Machines

---

# The Problem:

COVID-19 causes fluid build up in the lungs, which then requires use of ventilators for the patient to have sufficient oxygen. An insufficient supply of these will lead to increased mortality.

Note: Based on doctor interviews the pre-intubation procedure is oxygen therapy via nasal cannula while putting a mask over the person's mouth so they don't aerosolize virus when they exhale or cough.

Non-invasive ventilation machines like CPAP, BiPAP, and hi-flo oxygen are discouraged on the west coast because they aerosolize the room with virus during exhalation.

Intubation (invasive ventilation) happens when patients go critical after long enough (intubation may happen immediately or after deterioration; rapid shallow breaths, high CO2 levels, low O2 levels and heavy use of chest muscles are indicators for potential intubation). The vast majority of patients require sedation for successful initial intubation (reviewed by Midwest Medical Practitioner, Cards).

# Current Global Resources:

- ~62,000 “full-featured” ventilator machines in US hospitals - exclusive of Strategic National Stockpile (["Mechanical ventilators in US acute care hospitals." 2010.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21149215) )
- ~98,000 other ventilator machines in US hospitals (["Mechanical ventilators in US acute care hospitals." 2010.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21149215) )
- ~30,000 in the Strategic National Stockpile ([interview with Dr. Irwin Redlener](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/03/13/redlender-intv-seema-verma-us-short-ventilators-coronavirus-sot-wth-vpx.cnn))
- Unknown number already in use
- “the Pentagon will provide civilian health authorities with 5 million respirator masks and 2,000 specialized ventilators” ([AP](https://apnews.com/c10792dbe708b0b1d15fe5515600030a), 3/17/20)
- “Officials at another manufacturer...just received an order for 10,000 ventilators from the German government. “The delivery of the order will stretch across the entire year and requires a substantial increase of the production capacity,” ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/demand-ventilators-spikes-coronavirus-looms/story?id=69597233), 3/14/20)
- “Hospitals are saying “we’ll take them all,” ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/demand-ventilators-spikes-coronavirus-looms/story?id=69597233), 3/14/20)

# Worst Case Expectation:

- “The report cited...a 2009 survey...indicating that hospitals could use both existing machines and pull older devices from storage, as well as the 8,900 sitting in emergency stockpiles. Combined,... roughly 200,000 devices, but that the number of available medical staff able to operate them at any one time would lower that number significantly. With some worse-case estimates showing **more than 900,000 people** could need ventilators, according to the American Hospital Association” ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/demand-ventilators-spikes-coronavirus-looms/story?id=69597233), 3/14/20).

# Staffing:

“A typical ICU ventilator requires three primary operators: a critical care doctor, respiratory therapist, and a nurse.” ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/demand-ventilators-spikes-coronavirus-looms/story?id=69597233), 3/14/20).

“A report yesterday by the critical-care society postulated an emergency staffing that has one ICU doctor overseeing 96 patients on ventilators. That doctor would command a staff of four non-ICU MDs brought in from other assignments, each of them looking after eight respiratory therapists, four ICU nurses and 12 non-ICU nurses (again, repurposed from other wards, like elective surgery)...there would be a role for quick courses in how to set up a particular model of ventilator and help the MD get the desired output. In a test run of emergency preparedness several years ago, Branson says, instructions in machine operation were given to medically trained people who had never seen the machine before: nurses, physicians, physical therapists and veterinarians. After a two-day, 16-hour course, the veterinarians scored the best.” ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2020/03/14/ventilator-maker-we-can-ramp-up-production-five-fold/#1db699545e9a) 3/14/20).

- **Quote**: “Nasal cannula-based oxygen therapy with a surgical mask or re-breather mask is the current gold standard for pre-critical patients, and all hospitalized patients will use it based on current practices.”

**Types of Ventilation** ([RC 2011](http://rc.rcjournal.com/content/56/8/1170))

Negative Pressure Ventilation (e.g. Iron Lung)

Note: this type of ventilator appears to be not indicated for COVID-19 - it was useful in polio cases were muscles were weakened, which is not the case with COVID-19 [TO BE REVIEWED BY A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL]

Positive Pressure Ventilation

Positive-Pressure Noninvasive Ventilation (NIV) (risk of aerosolized particles)

CPAP

BiPAP

Hi-Flo Oxygen

Positive-Pressure Invasive Ventilators

Intubation (Invasive Ventilation)

# Assembly/Fabrication Requirements:

Mask: the simplicity of the shape allows to obtain the object very quickly even from 20mm polystyrene sheets (better XPF) without needing to print it in 3D: template file "visiera_Template.pdf" for laser cutter, foam cutter, cnc cutters has been loaded. (Luca, 3/15/20)

DISCLAIMER:

-ineffective protection can be more dangerous than having nothing because it tends to reduce the level of prudence: make responsible use of it. Use suitable materials and glues to reduce the risk of breakage and therefore exposure during use.
